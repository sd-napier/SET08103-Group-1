Code of Conduct

Purpose:

Our team is committed to creating a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment while developing software that provides easy access to reporting on population information via an SQL database. This Code of Conduct outlines the standards for behaviour, communication, and collaboration to ensure our project’s success and maintain a positive and professional team culture.
By using Scrum and Kanban boards as our guiding frameworks, we will emphasise iterative development, continuous feedback, and transparent communication. Team members will actively participate in stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives, refining the backlog and keeping task boards updated. These practices ensure accountability, maintain project momentum, and deliver high-quality, reliable software as a team.

Our Values:

We aim to:

* - Promote respect, inclusion, and trust in all interactions.
* - Encourage constructive feedback and continuous learning.
* - Foster collaboration and transparency in software development.
* - Maintain high-quality, reliable, and ethical software practices.

Expected Behaviour (Programming Practices):

Team members are expected to:

* - Communicate respectfully and professionally in all channels (GitHub, Slack, meetings, email).
* - Attend meetings on time.
* - Provide constructive and actionable feedback during code reviews. (Maybe delete?)
* - Share knowledge, help teammates, and be open to guidance.
* - Follow the agreed Scrum/Kanban processes, attend stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
* - Include meaningful comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
* - Use clear and consistent names for variables, functions, and files.
* - Write modular code where possible, avoiding duplication and improving reusability.
* - Include unit tests or integration tests where applicable, and ensure the code passes tests before submitting.
* - Keep commit messages clear and descriptive, indicating the purpose of the change.

Collaboration and Code Review:

* Code reviews will occur every two weeks, and all team members should actively participate.
* - Feedback should be specific, constructive, and solution-oriented, avoiding personal attacks.
* - Approvals require understanding and alignment with team coding standards and best practices.
* - Encourage pair programming or mentoring if necessary to improve code quality.
* - Document discussions and decisions in GitHub issues or pull request comments for transparency.
* - Being late or not being ready when the meeting starts will result in the grade for that review being capped at 40%
* - Not attending the meeting at all will result in the grade being marked at 0% for that review.

Unacceptable Behaviour: (This may be overkill)

The following behaviours will not be tolerated:

* - Harassment, discrimination, or offensive comments related to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, age, or any personal characteristic.
* - Personal attacks, aggressive language, or public shaming.
* - Ignoring or obstructing team processes, such as Scrum/Kanban workflow or code review practices.
* - Sharing sensitive or private data irresponsibly, or deliberately sabotaging or behaving unethically in software development, is unacceptable.

//May be unnecessary 
* If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, report it immediately via [email@example.com] or a private GitHub issue marked confidential. Reports will be handled discreetly and fairly, with investigation if necessary. Enforcement may include warnings, temporary removal from the project, or permanent exclusion, depending on the severity of the behaviour. Team leads or project maintainers are responsible for ensuring reports are acted upon promptly.

Disciplinary Procedures
	We must work as a team. In cases where anyone is dismissed, they won’t be able to deliver the coursework and will fail the coursework. Dismissal from the team involves the following:
1. “An individual is evidenced as breaching the Code of Conduct.”
2. “Evidence is presented at the next available meeting with a member of the module delivery team.”
3. “The individual will have the opportunity to evidence mitigating circumstances either to the student team or privately to a member of the module delivery team.”
4. “The module delivery team retains the right to the final decision of whether the dismissal is warranted.”

* Our workflow is guided by Scrum/Kanban principles. Attend stand-ups and sprint ceremonies actively and on time, and update Kanban boards or sprint task lists to reflect accurate progress. Participate in retrospectives honestly, focusing on improvement. Collaboration is essential; blocking or ignoring tasks or team communication undermines progress.

* This Code of Conduct applies to all GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and commits. It also applies to team communication on Slack, email, meetings, and any other project-related channels. Additionally, it applies to all team activities related to development, testing, documentation, or project management.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. We encourage every team member to read, understand, and actively practice these standards.
